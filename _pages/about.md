I'm an AI researcher and physicist who enjoys building novel computational tools with and for domain experts - an area commonly known as AI4Science. My main specialty is simulating complex (bio-) physical systems and using that for inverse design. The tools I've developed typically involve some AI component, and over the years I've build up a broad range of knowledge, having worked in quantum computing, neuroscience and optics. Some of these tools are open-source, but unfortunately most are not public. My current interests gravitate slightly more towards using AI methods in physical systems or in manufacturing.

Besides a strong technical background I'm also active on the organisation side of things: during my studies I spent a year as external relations for a job fair (Wervingsdagen), had the national politics and finance portfolio during my year as university council, and during my PhD I started a coalition leading to higher salaries for all PhD candidates in my institute. 

In short: I enjoy building things on both a technical and organisational level which make people better at their jobs
